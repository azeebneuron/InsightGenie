## Key Findings and Patterns

1. **Outlier Detection**: Analysis revealed several outliers, notably in social support (48) and perceptions of corruption (194), suggesting potential areas to investigate for anomalies in the data.

2. **Trends Over Time**: 
   - **Social Support** shows a statistically significant upward trend (p-value < 0.001), indicating increasing social support across the dataset.
   - **Generosity** also demonstrates a positive trend (p-value < 0.05), signifying a growing inclination towards generosity among populations.
