## Detailed Analysis of Distributions and Correlations

### 1. Distribution Analysis

#### Overall Ratings
The distribution of the **overall** ratings is characterized by:
- **Mean**: 3.05
- **Median**: 3.0
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.76
- **Skewness**: 0.16 (indicating a slight right skew)

The slightly positive skew suggests that while most ratings cluster around the median, there are a few higher ratings that could influence the mean, indicating potential outliers.

#### Quality Ratings
The **quality** ratings' distribution is as follows:
- **Mean**: 3.21
- **Median**: 3.0
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.80
- **Skewness**: 0.02 (indicating nearly symmetrical distribution)

This near-symmetrical distribution signifies that quality ratings are more evenly spread, with half the ratings below 3.0 and half above.

### 2. Correlation Analysis

The correlation between key metrics reveals significant relationships:
- **Overall vs. Quality**: 0.83 (strong positive correlation)
- **Overall vs. Repeatability**: 0.51 (moderate positive correlation)
